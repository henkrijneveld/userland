Raspberry userland repository with additional raspigemcam. raspigemcam is the proprietary camera driver for gemcam (github.com/henkrijneveld/Gemcam.git)

**Documentation**
The documentatation of the original raspimjpeg can be found here: http://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface

In addition, raspigemcam offers the extra functions:
- Command parameter -bp <path>, aka basepath. When provided this path will be prepended to the filepaths in the configuration file, if they do not start with a '/' (so no absolute path in the configuration file).
- The files to which the basepath can be prepended are: base_path, preview_path, image_path, lapse_path, video_path, status_file, control_file and media_path.
- The configurationfile is renamed to raspigemcam.cfg (instead of plain raspimjpeg).
- At startup, first the program will check for a configuration file in the current working directory. If not found, it will look for /etc/Å•aspigemcam.cfg.


**Additional files**
Directory raspgemcam contains the executable and configuration file.

**Building**
Clone on a Pi, run ./buildme. Maybe you have to install utilities lik cmake first. "They" say that crosscompiling is possible, I would say: use a pi.

After the build, raspigemcam can be found in /opt/vc/bin on the pi. Copy this file to the raspgemcam-bin directory (after some testing, please).

**Acknowledgements**
raspigemcam is a modified version from raspimjpeg (https://github.com/roberttidey/userland). As raspigemcam will (now or in the future) not be backwards compatible, and only will be used with the HQ cam, and only for still images, a copy instead of a fork is created. To avoid confusion, the name is changed.

**Original Readme from raspberry/userland**

This repository contains the source code for the ARM side libraries used on Raspberry Pi.
These typically are installed in /opt/vc/lib and includes source for the ARM side code to interface to:
EGL, mmal, GLESv2, vcos, openmaxil, vchiq_arm, bcm_host, WFC, OpenVG.

Use buildme to build. It requires cmake to be installed and an ARM cross compiler. For 32-bit cross compilation it is set up to use this one:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian

Whilst 64-bit userspace is not officially supported, some of the libraries will work for it. To cross compile, install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu and g++-aarch64-linux-gnu first. For both native and cross compiles, add the option ```--aarch64``` to the buildme command.

Note that this repository does not contain the source for the edidparser and vcdbg binaries due to licensing restrictions.

**Original Readme from the creators of raspimjpeg (Jul 1, 2015)**

RaspiMJPEG is an OpenMAX-Application based on the mmal-library, which is comparable to and inspired by RaspiVid and RaspiStill. RaspiMJPEG can record 1080p 30fps videos and 5 Mpx images into a file. But instead of showing the preview on a screen, RaspiMJPEG streams the preview as MJPEG into a file. The update-rate and the size of the preview are customizable with parameters and independent of the captured image/video. Once started, the application receives commands with a unix-pipe and showes its status on stdout and writes it into a status-file. The program terminates itself after receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM.

Example usage as MJPEG-Streamer: raspimjpeg -w 640 -h 360 -d 5 -q 70 -of /path/to/image.jpg

This command creates the image "path/to/image.jpg" with the size 640x360 px and updates it every time, 5 frames are captured, which gives (30/5=) 6fps. The image proportions are recommended to be 16:9, the jpg-quality is set with -q. This way used, RaspiMJPEG serves as MJPEG-streamer and the preview can be shown on a website for example. To achieve a high update-rate (e.g. "-d 1"), it is recommended to save the file into the ram and not on the sd-card (e.g. "-of /dev/shm/image.jpg"). If -w, -h and -d are not set, the default setting is used (320x180, 6fps, quality 85). This way used, RaspiMJPEG can also record a timelapse with many frames per second, if the -of parameter is set as /pat/to/image%04d.jpg.

*Note HR: command line parameters where removed at a certain moment*
Example usages as MJPEG-Streamer with video and image capture: raspimjpeg -w 320 -h 180 -d 5 -of /path/to/image.jpg -cf /path/to/pipe -vf /path/to/video.h264 -if /path/to/image_%04d.jpg

This command does the same as the one above, but it is also listening on the pipe, defined with the parametet -c. If another program writes "ca 1" into the pipe (shell: echo "ca 1" > /path/to/pipe), the application continues with the MJPEG-stream, but starts also a H264-capture 1080p 30fps into the defined file. The capture is stopped with the command "ca 0" via pipe. A new capture overwrites the defined file, except the filename includes a %d for the video-number. To make MJPEG and H264 possible, it is recommended to write the image file only into the ram, as described above. If you write "im" into the pipe, it captures an image and saves it with the path given after -if. Other pipe-options are described below.

Example usage as MJPEG-streamer with video capture and status-output: raspimjpeg -w 320 -h 180 -d 5 -of /path/to/image.jpg -cf /path/to/pipe -vf /path/to/video.h264 -sf /path/to/textfile.txt

Until now, RaspiMJPEG wrote its status into stdout/stderr. With this new command, the status is also written into a textfile (no logging, just the newest status). Possible messages and their meanings are: ready --> MJPEG is streaming, not capturing video --> MJPEG is streaming and video is capturing boxing --> MJPEG is streaming and video is packed into mp4 image --> MJPEG is streaming and image is capturing timelapse --> MJPEG is streaming and timelapse is active halted --> RaspiMJPEG is idle md_ready --> See 'ready', motion is detection active md_video --> See 'video', motion is detection active md_boxing --> See 'boxing', motion is detection active errror --> An error occured and the application terminated

Possible parameters: -ic set the offset for image output numbering -vc set the offset for video output numbering
